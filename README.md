# My Awesome MiniApp project

# MiniApp is the one webpage website with Mini Cooper Car Models using:-
* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* JS
* Vue
* PHP
* AJAX
* MySQL
 
 # Description 
  
I have used everything we have covered so far in this course to make this webpage as demanded by the Professor Trevor, our instructor for Multimedia Authoring 3.
App is created using SASS, AJAX, database and fetch connected through PHP and then rendered with Vue.js

# To use this you will simply have to import the database (sql) into your Sql server application, then you will have to run it on your localhost. By double clicking any one of the model you will be able to see more content about the car.
